            Hi! I am Ivan James Lo, a first-year college student taking up BS Computer Science at Ateneo de Davao University. I am 19 years old and turning 20 in a few days. 
            I reside in Bangkal, Davao City, and I belong to Sir Francis Lloyd Singson's class with the class code 16-411. 
            <br><br>
            For context, I'm not so much of a physically active person, but I am not also idle. Because of this, I find the journey I have been through in this course (PE 1114) to be physically challenging but rewarding. 
            This course slapped me with the reality that I need to do more physical activity and exercises because I've noticed that I easily get tired and drained after doing some exercises. 
            Moreover, I really had a hard time doing push-ups (which you will see in the Pre-Test and Post-Test of the Movement Competency Screen). 
            Thus, I ask for your kind consideration and judgment when browsing this website.
            <br><br>
            On the brighter side, I got to know my limits and improved some aspects of my physical fitness. The improvement may not be drastic, but it is still an improvement. 
            Some of the skills and knowledge I learned from the activities done in this course are the following. First, how to properly warm up and cool down my body and the importance of these. 
            Second, how to properly assess my body's strengths and weaknesses and enhance those identified weaknesses. Last but not least, appreciate the importance of doing physical exercises daily. 
            These skills and knowledge will help me pursue a life-long fitness journey as these will motivate me to keep exercising and remind myself that being physically active is essential if I want to live a longer and healthier life.
        </p>

    <h4>Do's and Don'ts</h4>

    <p>
        Before moving forward, we should be reminded of some of the do's and don'ts of exercise to prevent injuries and accidents. Also, these will be your guide to whether you are fit to exercise for the day or not. 
        Exercise is essential, but if you don't know the do's and don'ts, you might suffer in the end.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are some of the Do's and Don'ts:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th><b>Do's</b></th>
            <th><b>Don'ts</b></th>

        <tr>
            <th>Do exercise when you're in good condition.</th>
            <th>Don't engagae in physical activity / exercise when you are not feeling well.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Do 30-40 minutes workout twice or thrice a week.</th>
            <th>Don't overlook yourself while exercising.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Do ensure that you have covered all body areas for your exercise.</th>
            <th>Don't always focus on a single form of training.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Do eat enough food and drinkk enough liquids to avoid passing out.</th>
            <th>Don't eat heavy meals or drink too many liquids before exercising.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Do make exercise a habit.</th>
            <th>Don't be too obsessed with exercise.</th>
        </tr>

            Upon doing the MCS Pre-Test exercises, I was both happy and sad. I felt happy because I was able to do all the activities without injuries or accidents, and I was able to determine my strengths and weaknesses. 
            I also felt sad because I realized that there's a lot to improve on, especially in push-ups. But this motivated me as well to do even better. As you click on the picture and watch the videos, I ask for your kindness.

        <h4>Module 1</h4>
        <h6>Which among the 4 Physical Education Quotes below strikes you the most and why? </h6>
        <p>Among the four, the one that really struck me was the third quote ("Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.”) because of the second part of the statement. Whenever I am asked, "Where do you live?" the automatic answer that 
            pops up in my head is my house. Only after reading this statement did I realize that I live inside my body, and it is the only place where I must live in order to survive. Sure, I need a house to shelter in, but even if this house is destroyed, 
            I can find a new house in a different place or reconstruct it. However, if I took my body for granted, I could not find a replacement— I would be dead. Thus, the only place that I have to live in to continue breathing in this world is my body; 
            therefore, I should take good care of it. Aside from this realization, I was impressed that it is the shortest quote among the four, but the message it contains is the deepest, at least for me.
        </p><br>

        <h4>Module 2</h4>
        <h6>How can you make sure you benefit from performing the different Stretching Exercises as you enhance your movement competencies?</h6>
        <p>I can ensure that I benefit from performing the different stretching exercises as I enhance my movement competencies by faithfully following the number of sets and repetitions required for that particular stretching exercise and the moves correctly. 
            When doing those stretches, I would observe proper execution and posture and make sure that all parts of my body, from head to toe, were stretched to avoid possible injuries and accidents while doing workouts or exercises. I would not take for granted 
            the different stretching exercises; I would remind myself that these stretches are essential for me to have a healthier body.
        </p><br>

        <h4>Module 3</h4>
        <h6>As you grow older, how does understanding your health-related fitness components become more relevant in the enhancement of your movements? </h6>
        <p>As I grow older, my understanding of my health-related components becomes more relevant in the enhancement of my movements because I noticed that I am not as active as before, and my body tires out faster compared to when I was younger. 
            The reason behind this is that I often take exercise for granted because of my current schedule. Instead of being physically active, like going for a walk or doing outdoor activities with my family or friends, I go to my room, sit down, and look at my laptop 
            to do assignments and tasks. Due to this, I have a stiffer body, difficulty performing some exercises, and run out of breath quickly when doing vigorous activities. After knowing these changes in my body, I realized that I am becoming physically unfit, 
            and I need to do something about it, or else I will suffer the consequences in the long run. Thus, my understanding of health-related components became more relevant in enhancing my movements because it made me realize what I should do to become healthier and fit. 
            Also, it reminds me to do some simple exercises from time to time. This is important as we grow older so that we can enjoy what we are doing now until our senior years.
        </p><br>

        <h4>Module 4</h4>
        <h6>How does MCS post test help an individual to understand the significance of the enhancement of Movement Competency?</h6>
        <p>MCS post-test helps an individual to understand the significance of the enhancement of Movement Competency by allowing us to realize the areas where we improved and still need improvement. Also, the MCS post-test will be your gauge of whether you've achieved your goal 
            fully or are still in the process. With your improvement in different aspects of movement competency, you will be able to do more things and become more active. Essentially, the MCS post-test helps you appreciate your current movement competency and will also motivate 
            you to keep improving or enhancing those areas in the movement competency that you find yourself lacking to become holistically healthy.
        </p><br><br>

        <h3>In Conclusion...</h3>
        <p>The most significant takeaway I got from my learning experiences, and journey in this course was to take my physical wellness seriously. Physical activities and exercises are vital to maintaining a healthy mind and body. It doesn't matter whether you are vigorously doing 
            some physical exercises or not; what matters is that you take your time to do it. In this world wherein most things are done online and forcing us to sit down and face our screens, it is crucial for us to be mindful that we should do some physical activities and exercises 
            to be functional as citizens of this world and to achieve our dreams in the future. We should not take physical activities, workouts, or exercises for granted because once we do, we will have a weak and fragile body that cannot withstand the harsh reality the world gives us.
